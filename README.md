## Chinese Character Recognition app

This is a chinese character recognition app written in C which makes use of the SDL library to provide a graphical user interface. The underlying algorithm employs islands in matrices to classify the characters according to their features and provide more accurate results.

### How it works

The user is presented with a drawing pane on the left, where they can draw a character. Then, suggested characters will be presented on the right hand side grid. If they click on one of the images, that character will be copied to their clipboard for them to lookup.
